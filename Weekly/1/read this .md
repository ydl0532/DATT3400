I made a disco-like random art in Processing where most vars are random numbers(gen some floting number is funny). The discussion of true random number generators (TRNG) and pseudo random number generators (PRNG) in class was very interesting. I had never heard of this aspect before, so I looked up some relevant information after class. Now, in order to protect security, a hybrid solution is used: TRNG is used to generate high-quality random seeds, and PRNG is used to expand and generate more random numbers4. This method not only ensures the quality of randomness, but also meets the efficiency requirements. For example, Intel. I learned some very useful knowledge. Thank you very much.
